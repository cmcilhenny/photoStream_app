# Place all the behaviors and hooks related to the matching controller here.
# All this logic will automatically be available in application.js.

#logic for rotating images goes here:

#set an empty var for currentImage:

var currentImage = []

# pull up a list of all photos from a given event from active record in an array. Each photo will be identified by its id (from active record).

 
#make sure the list is ordered smallest to greatest. 

function rotateImage () {
#pull up the first image 
	
#display it on the page. 
}

#repeat
var timer = setInterval(rotateImage, 5000)
